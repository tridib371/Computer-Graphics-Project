# 🏔️ Mountain View — Computer Graphics Project (C++ / OpenGL)

Welcome to **Mountain View**, a **Computer Graphics project** developed in **C++ using OpenGL** with **Code::Blocks**.  
This project demonstrates fundamental computer graphics concepts and creates a **3D mountain landscape visualization**.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Mountain View** is a C++ OpenGL project that:

- Implements **2D and 3D graphics rendering**  
- Demonstrates **OpenGL primitives, transformations, and lighting**  
- Creates a **realistic mountain landscape scene**  
- Utilizes additional graphics techniques such as **texturing and shading**

This project is suitable for students who want to **practice graphics programming and OpenGL rendering**.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🏞️ Realistic mountain visualization with **3D shapes**  
- 🔹 Use of **OpenGL primitives** (points, lines, triangles)  
- 🔹 **Transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling  
- 🔹 **Lighting and shading** for depth perception  
- 🔹 Optional **texturing** for realistic effects  
- ⚙️ Built and tested in **Code::Blocks (C++17+)**
